# CUCardSwiper
Gets the names of whoever's card was swiped through a magnetic strip reader. (works only with CU cards)

I made this because I had originally made it in c++ but realized that it wouldn't be easily portable so I switched to java and then later learned that Apple does not allow external java code to run so I resorted to making a web version of this app.
